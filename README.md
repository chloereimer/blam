# blam

**blam** is a weapon damage calculator for borderlands 3 so i can think less, shoot more ðŸ¤ 

blam knows about things like weapon stats, weapon elements, and enemy armour types. it can use that information to calculate a weapon's maximum damage per second against a single target with one type of armour. blam has also been written as an api, but i interact with it exclusively through the rails console.

## building blam better

in future, it would be pretty neat if blam knew about things like character abilities that impact weapon stats (e.g. reducing reload time, adding additional elemental damage), enemies with multiple armour types, and probably lots of other things. fleshing out the api endpoints and building a proper cli (or even gui!) would also make it much easier to use. also, it turns out that borderlands 2 is objectively better in every single way, so it'd be great if blam could support multiple games in the series.
